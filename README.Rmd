# biolabr

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of biolabr is to provide a consistent location to store and access R functions that I have found to be useful for various things in the laboratory. The functions contained within this package will appear to be somewhat eclectic, but they will all be intended to provide a solution for various microbiology lab related activities that seem to reoccur and aren't complex enough to require a dedicated package on their own.
