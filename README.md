# biolabr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of biolabr is to provide a consistent location to store and
access R functions that I have found to be useful for various things in
the laboratory. The functions contained within this package will appear
to be somewhat eclectic, but they will all be intended to provide a
solution for various microbiology lab related activities that seem to
reoccur and arenâ€™t complex enough to require a dedicated package on
their own.
